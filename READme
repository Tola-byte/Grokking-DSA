Grokking C++ — Learning & Projects
=================================

This repository is my personal C++ learning workspace. It's split into three main areas so I can study algorithms, keep notes, and build projects.

Structure
---------
- `grokking-algorithms/`: Data Structures & Algorithms — practice implementations and problem-solving exercises.
	- Example subfolders: `binary_search`, `graphs`, `dynamic_programming`, `trees`, etc.
- `learning-C++/`: Notes and short example files used while learning C++ features and idioms (constructors, templates, RAII, STL, etc.).
- `projects/`: Small projects and exercises where I apply what I learn (e.g., `student_average`).

- If you're using the included VS Code task, open the C++ file you want to compile and run the task `C/C++: clang build active file`.

How I use this repo
--------------------
- Learn a concept in `learning-C++/` and create a minimal example.
- Practice problem solving in `grokking-algorithms/` and commit working solutions.
- Build small apps in `projects/` to combine concepts and demonstrate progress.
